With my Bachelors in Biology and a Masters in Data Analytics, I want to combine my two understandings and apply them into becoming a bioinformatician. Even at my young age, I wish to continue to grow, gather, and learn the tools I need to reach this goal of mine. With these projects from Western Governors University, I hope that my personal pioneering into this field can be noticed and that my character can be seen.

The following projects are from my time in the Master of Science in Data Analytics at Western Governors University from October 2022 through October 2023.
