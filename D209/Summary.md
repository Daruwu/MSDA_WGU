# D209: Data Mining I

## Course Summary

WGU states that D209 Data Mining I expands predictive modeling into nonlinear dimensions, enhancing the capabilities and effectiveness of the data analytics lifecycle. In this course, learners implement supervised models—specifically classification and prediction data mining models—to unearth relationships among variables that are not apparent with more surface-level techniques. The course provides frameworks for assessing models’ sensitivity and specificity.

This course has two Practical Assessments. 

## Course Objectives

WGU outlines the following competencies as a part of this class:
- **Classification Data Mining Models:** The graduate applies observations to appropriate classes and categories using classification models.
- **Predictive Data Mining MOdels:** The graduate implements prediction data mining models to find hard-to-spot relationships among variables.
- **Data Mining Model Performance:** The graduate evaluates data mining model performance for precision, accuracy, and model comparison.
